# Store Simulation

This Python simulation project models and analyzes the operation of a souvenir store, using advanced variance reduction techniques. It simulates the arrival of groups of tourists, their tour through the store, the payment process and their exit, with the objective of evaluating and optimizing the operation of the business.

## Project Description

The project uses variance reduction techniques, especially complementary numbers, to improve the accuracy of the simulations. Key aspects simulated include:

- Random arrival of tour groups.
- Store tour with varying times.
- Payment process with random waiting times.
- Absence of the guide to manage tickets, with variable intervals.
- Calculation of the average queuing time of tourists shopping and the average time each group spends in the entire system.

## Results

The project provides key metrics on the operational performance of the souvenir business, using advanced variance reduction techniques to ensure more accurate and reliable results. The results help identify areas for improvement and make informed decisions to optimize the customer experience.


## Conclusions

Continuous learning in simulation and variance reduction techniques not only improves technical skills, but also prepares to face future challenges in complex systems modeling and data-driven decision making. In addition, it allows exploring new tools and methods that could provide more efficient and accurate solutions in different business contexts.
